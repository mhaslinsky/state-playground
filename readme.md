## Basic react hook test ground

just using this project to start learning how to use react hooks in tandem with one another  
and more importantly manage my projects using git moving forward through powershell  
useContext and Context.Provider being used to handle login logic across child components  
various state and reducer variables being used to track form login logic and validity  
useref and imperativehandle being used to handle change of focus to form field that is invalid when login attempted  
useEffect applied to limit how often form checks for validity
